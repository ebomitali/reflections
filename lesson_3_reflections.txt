When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- remote repository allows to share work with other people
- as a backup of main commits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- should say that when pulling there may be merge conflicts that I should administer. Therefore I should
chose the right time to perform pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- fork is when I would take another work in order to further develop it without contributing
- clone is when I create a local copy from github to work on. Ow when I want to leverage on
  an existing code base in another project
- branch when I want to add some feature (temporary branch) or when I want to
  develop some derivatives with a few different features. Compare with clone
