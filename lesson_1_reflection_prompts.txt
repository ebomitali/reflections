How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because in long file spotting the differences limit the amount 
	of text to check. Checking code without typo is very boring

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because it allows to fix typos and error introduced over the time by checking
	previous version. It allow to restore rapidly a working context
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing commit pro
	- control version over a possibly great number of files
	- add message to commit
	cons
	- forgot to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    - dev usually involves several files
	- docs usually involves a single file
